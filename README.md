Compensato
==============

This program requires Ruby on Rails running on a Linux/Unix based system. Just enter the Compensato directory and run with:

rails s

Then navigate to 127.0.0.1:3000 or localhost:3000 in your browser of choice.

***************
IMPORTANT!
***************

You must have a Windows partition manually mounted or linked at /media/compensato_client in your local linux environment for Compensato to find it at the moment.

For the time being the client system must also have a "Compensato" directory manually created on its root. This will be automated later.
